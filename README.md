### History
These small devices are known by many FAKE names on the internet, mostly using the name Arduino ATmega32u4 & Arduino Beetle Board.   
After opening up the device, it is not a Arduino at all - it is a cheap Chinese clone.   
 
However in this case - the clone is actually SMALLER & MORE ROBUST than the Devices it is Pretending to be, the board is actually marked as HW-374, so this is what I'll refer to it as.  
 
       
### PROJECT
> Due to the disappointing amount of information on this board, i have decided to do my own trace of the tracks to the PIN's, the aim was to find out if any usable digital pins are available - and amazingly their actually is ( PIN 13 )
